        <p>Greetings! My name is Jeremy Joseph Lee. I'm passionate about education, music, coding, and facilitating fun and
          knowledge--preferably at the same time. I have a BA in anthropology and East Asian studies from the University
          at Albany, SUNY, and an MA in applied linguistics from the University of Montana. I currently teach English as
          a Second Language (ESL) to adult learners at the University of Arizona here in Tucson. I've also done teacher training
          here and in Guangzhou, China, and in Hermosillo, Mexico.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While facilitating learning is an essential component of my educational methodology, I also love extending that belief
          to my hobby of serving as a radio DJ. The Waiting Room is a two-hour weekly show on
          <strong>99.1FM//
            <a href="https://www.downtownradio.org/" target="_blank">Downtown Radio</a>
          </strong> hosted by me as my alter ego: DoctorSlow. In this role I curate a live musical "mixtape" of sorts comprised of
          new, old, local, and international "left-of-the-dial" rock'n'roll. My show airs every Thursday from 7-9am and can
          be heard over the airwaves in Tucson or streamed worldwide from the website or our mobile app: Downtown Radio Tucson.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a fullstack web developer, I hope to bridge these worlds and bring my patience and knowledge as an educator to
          web projects and bridge the gap between front-end users or clients and the all to often esoteric nature of web
          design and development. Ideally, I will be able to work with musicians, record labels, or even radio stations and
          truly see my passions connected and blossom.</p>
